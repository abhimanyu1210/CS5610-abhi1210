            <div>
                <p>
                    Exercise Tracker is a page accessible only to registered users where they can select the type of exercise, log its 
                    length and check the calories that they burned doing that exercise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once this information is available, the user can go ahead and log the workout or navigate back to home page.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>The page is divided into 2 sections:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Look Up Exercise</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users can choose their exercise type from the drop-down list which covers most of the exercises we do.</li>
                            <li>Then they need to input the length of their exercise</li>
                            <li>Finally, the date for which the exercise needs to be logged</li>
                        </ul>
                        <hr />
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Calories Burned</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once above information is given, the user can calculate the calories that he burned</li>
                            <li>This section is initially invisible and is displayed when the user inputs all the necessary fields and hits the 'Calculate Calories' button</li>
                            <li>The user can then log the number of calories that he burned against a particular date.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
