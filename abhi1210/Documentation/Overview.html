            <h3>1) About "Healthy Gobbler":</h3>

                <h4><strong>Target Audience</strong>: No age boundaries. Any person who plans to track and control their diet can use this application.</h4>
            </div>

                    "Healthy Gobbler" is an online dietary tracker which helps users to track their daily calorie intake. Registered
                    users can see their daily recommended calorie intake, log meals they have and log exercises they do during a day.
                    This application can serve as a hub for people who want to control their diet and stay fit. Users can also connect with people
                    sailing in the same boat. They can follow other users in the application and check their activities which come as a feed to them.

            <h3>2) Why health and fitness?</h3>
            <div>
               <ul>
                   <li>
                       Unhealthy eating habits have contributed to the obesity epidemic in the United States. About one-third of
                       U.S. adults (33.8%) are obese and approximately 17% (or 12.5 million) of children and
                       adolescents aged 2—19 years are obese.
                   </li>
                   <li>A poor diet is associated with major health risks that can cause illness</li>
                   <li>These include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Heart disease</li>
                            <li>Hypertension (high blood pressure)</li>
                            <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
                            <li>Osteoporosis</li>
                            <li>Certain types of cancer</li>
                        </ul>
                   </li>
                   <li>

                            By making smart food choices, you can help protect yourself
                            from these health problems.
                       </strong>

                   <li>
                       Apart from the facts mentioned above, one of the biggest reasons why I chose this domain was the objective of 
                       creating a complete application. Along with CS-5610 Web-Development I have opted for CS-5500 Mobile Application Development.
                       The final project I am trying to build in that course is a gaming app for children (age: 9-19 years) that teaches them importance of nutrients
                       in food we eat on daily basis. The android app will be a great addition to this web-application. 
                   </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Professor Jose Annunziato's lecture material was the most important reference for creating this web application.
                    Recorded lectures helped me to go back and check if I was following best practices
                    to create this application.
