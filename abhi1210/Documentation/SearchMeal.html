            <div>
                <p>
                    This is page that is accessible to both registered and unregistered users. Both users 
                    can take full advantage of the powerfull Yummly Food And Nutrition API and search meals they have on day to 
                    day basis. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially the search results section of the page is hidden. When the user fires a query, the application fetches 
                    meals that match user's search. If there are no results returned, the user is informed accordingly. If there are results,
                    the window scrolls down automatically to the results section and it shows the matches in a grid format. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing to note here is that the user gets to see the first 12 results on the first page. The user can use pagination controllers 
                    to change the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the user selects the meal that matches his query the most, the application takes the user to the meal details page.
                </p>
            </div>
