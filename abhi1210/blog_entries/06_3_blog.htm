    This week I had to work during my spring break to cover up all the pending experiments for last week.
    There was a lot of pending work due to midterms and project submissions for other courses. The professor
    covered MongoDB in class that week. I completed my experiements on MongoDB following instructions from 
    professor and also sketched out a layout for my project.
