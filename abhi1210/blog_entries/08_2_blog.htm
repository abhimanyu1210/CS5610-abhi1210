    This week I continued working with jquery exploring various effects and widgets offered.
    I finished coding for pagination using jquery and javascript. I also started working with Web API and
    JSON and how JSON objects can be parsed.

    Due to a busy week with interviews and career fair I could only complete 4 experiments this week.
    Will make for it in the next week.
