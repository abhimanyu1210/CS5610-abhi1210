<p>
    This week I continued working with API experiments. I worked with different types of API's like Weather, Music <br />
    and one of the most famous - Google Maps. I moved on to Angular experiments later in the week. This is the first time <br />
    I am working with Angular JS. I performed an introductory experiment first and then moved on to combine the powers <br />
    of API and Angular JS to show local time of city entered in the search.
