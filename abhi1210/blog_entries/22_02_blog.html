    It has been a very busy week for me. Not only am I pre-occupied but also I am finding Angular JS
    a bit complex. May be through practice I could make it work. I will be making up for missed experiments 
    in this week's schedule in the next week. After practicing Angular JS more, I'll keep doing more
    experiments

    <ul>
        Tasks Completed:
        <li>Angular JS Routing Introduction</li>
        <li>Sharing Data In Angular JS Routing</li>
        <li>Using $routeParams to pass parameters between views.</li>
    </ul>
