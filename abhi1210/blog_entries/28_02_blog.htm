    This week I worked on experiments with Node JS. I started off by simply checking if the server Node JS
    created responds to a call from client. The next 2 experiments are a simple movie API where the static
    data resides on server. The user can add, update and remove this static data. Later in the week I added 
    experiments on Node JS server hosted on cloud platform called OpenShift.

    <ul>
        Tasks Completed:
        <li>Connecting to server created locally</li>
        <li>Creating a movie app where remove requests are handled by server</li>
        <li>Adding add, update Requests to earlier experiment</li>
        <li>Used OpenShift to host server Node JS and added technical details to movie app</li>
        <li>Created a weather app where Web-service call to open-weather api is made from server.js</li>
    </ul>
