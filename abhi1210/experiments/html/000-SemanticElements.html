            but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that 
            are extremely painful.Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, 
            because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him 
            some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, 
            except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy
             a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

                    pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the

                <p>
                    The objective of this experiment was to familiarize myself with the new semantic elements in HTML5 like nav, section, article, mark, header etc.

                <p>
                    This experiment was aimed to learn the basics of HTML5 and explore all the new semantic elements. 
                    This was based on the Professors examples in class to learn to modularize the structure of HTML page.
                    These practices will be followed in future experiments and projects which will involve more complex coding.
